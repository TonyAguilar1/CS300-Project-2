# CS300-Project-2

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
We were tasked with solving how to load courses into a data structure as they are read from a csv file, 
print out the available courses in alphanumeric order, and lastly be able to search for a particular course and print out the description as well as the pre-requisites it requires. 
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem with first taking into account the layout of the csv file. Once that was clear, I was able to establish the code to read the file, 
previously brainstormed via flowchart and pseudocode, load it into a vector, sort the order of the classes via quicksort algorithm, and lastly print out the contents of said vector. 
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Patience, debugging, researching as well as taking previous work from the course as example of how to validate the output. 
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
It has allowed me to better understand re-usable, efficient, scalable code that serves multiple projects. 
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
As mentioned above, being able to re-use code that was previously served a similar purpose, has allowed me to understand 
the importance of making maintainable, readable and adaptable code.
